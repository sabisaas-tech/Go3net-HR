**Summary of Color Usage:**

The Go3net website consistently uses a core palette of **bright blue**, **white**, **black/dark grey**, and **green** as an accent. The bright blue is a prominent branding color, used for calls to action, highlights, and key graphical elements. White and light grey provide clean backgrounds, while black/dark grey ensures readability of text. The green is used sparingly for the logo and some interactive elements, adding a fresh touch. This consistent application of colors creates a cohesive and professional brand identity.
