# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive Go3net HR Management System that provides core HR functionalities including employee management, recruitment, payroll, performance tracking, and administrative tools. The system will be built with Express.js(authentication etc) framework backend using Supabase database(public.users) with a well-defined schema, React frontend with structured CSS architecture, mobile-responsive design, and push notifications support.
